# ChirpR-OS-Preview---T-Deck-Pro-
A preview of the firmware im working on for the Lilygo T Deck Pro

**Please ignore the screen burn in  - this is my first time working with e-paper displays! I learnt very quickly what NOT to do!! its a dev device anyway ;)

This is still a major work in progress but its coming together nicely. A full e-paper refresh system has been put in place now (partial refresh for items displayed and a full refresh every 20 mins to stop burn in and ghosting)

Next steps are to implement a "Homescreen" that it lands on with time and weather info (pulled from wifi and weather api's) and a notification area to show messages etc when the LoRa side of things is completed.

Below is whats already implemented:

Power off/Ship Mode (displays and then powers the device off - like test firmware)
