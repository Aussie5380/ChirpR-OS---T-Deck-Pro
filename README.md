A preview of the firmware im working on for the Lilygo T Deck Pro. I have used the test firmware examples from the device as a guide to build upon. ***Please note i do all of this in my spare time, so updates etc wont all ways be scheduled, although if people would like to help make this the best firmware for the T Deck Pro, i would love people to join and contribute!***

***DISCLAIMER - This firmware has been developed for the Audio variant of the T Deck Pro (Not the 4G version). As the firmware has been built off the test firmware, it handles the component detection in the exact same way - You are free to test this firmware on your device if you have the 4G version, however you do so at your own risk and do so knowing the music player will not generate which may cause system failure. I will not accept any responsibility for device failure or bricking (however this is extremley difficult to acheive). I dont own a 4G version to test this as of yet, however if there is enough interest and i can get some feed back from 4G version users if they test it, i can see what i can do to patch the 4G version to enable it to boot etc if required. I will order a 4G version when i can afford it. No work is being planned on 4G development for this device, now, or in the future.***

***Progress Reports***

**Please ignore the screen burn in  - this is my first time working with e-paper displays! I learnt very quickly what NOT to do!! its a dev device anyway ;)***

I am currently preparing MeshCore's LoRa implementation which will require a rework the UI for e-paper to setup, register and send messages via LoRa. This will not be included in the first beta test builds.

A big shout out to Andy at MeshCore for graciously allowing me to implement MeshCore's Mesh Network instead of building one from the ground up! This will significantly reduce development time!

***BETA TESTING IS OPENING WITHIN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS - STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES***

Below is whats been implemented so far:

***UPDATE Friday July 4 @ 12.00 PM - Version 1.6.5***

A small adjustment has been made to the move apps function, which now includes 3 new icon packs! Users now have the choice of the standard icons, simple, modern or funky icon packs, then can continue to rearrange the apps to their prefrences! Icon themes persist across reboot. Again this one kept me up for the last few days but its in and working!

Now the final customisation feature is in, i need to finlaise eveything else in the firmware and polish a few features and its ready for testing!!!

**Update 30 June 2025 @ 10:13pm - Version 1.6.4***

Have finally implemented the move apps function. Hold down on an app and the Move App's modal appears. Hit start and complete the grids on both pages and hit save and it will recreate the apps screen to your prefrence and persist through reboots. Lists are dynamic and remove already selected options. This has kept me awake for a few days but its finally in!

***Update 29 June 2025 @ 9:54pm - Version 1.6.3***

BLE functionality has now been built in for the T Watch intergration.

![IMG_20250629_213631142_HDR_PORTRAIT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff2172ce-e164-42c0-a6ce-04dc6cb3bbf6)

Updated the About icon and have changed the information available. Now contains unique device name (based on hashed and truncated mac addresses)

![IMG_20250629_213616292_HDR_PORTRAIT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37606d8e-06da-4499-bd99-5c8070f25959)

Have implemented a boot intervention for plugging the device in. To stop the system from just booting, it now brings up a menu to charge the device only or start the system. If charge is seletced it will take you to the charge screen which shows the time and charge status and a start system button. A power icon is in the corner to switch device off.

![IMG_20250629_213757001_HDR_PORTRAIT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46fb1ec5-be9d-452b-81e9-3e9af108a22d)

Also a critical battery feature has been put in place to stop battery degredation if the device is left and runs out of battery. it now shuts down and puts a similar message on the screen to the power off mode, that advises the user the device battery is critically low and they need to charge their battery.A few other smaller fixes under the hood.

A few days left until the first beta version is released! Stay tuned!!

***UPDATE 25 June 2025 @ 6:08pm - Version 1.5.0***

Health uses the steps counter and onboard AI chip to generate health insights and tracking. This will be further linked with the T Watch S3 Plus once firmware development begins in a few weeks (waiting for the device to arrive so i can start)

![IMG_20250625_180709990_HDR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a54e957b-553a-4852-a875-5b9a481487aa)

Have put a toggle in Lock Screen Settings to turn off/on "turn display off after 3 mins with no action on lockscreen" for further power savings.

![IMG_20250625_180742093_HDR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e547cb8-a93e-4246-b9c5-6fc6c7008215)

Other smaller fixes under the hood have been completed (date removed from top bar to reduce crowding - still available on home screen, lock screen and quick settings panel) Final work on a few of the apps needs to be completed and tested, and then its ready for beta testing!

Have implemented further power saving on the lockscreen. When unused for 3 mins while on the lockscreen it clears the display and turns the display off, and wakes up with touch/keyboard press
